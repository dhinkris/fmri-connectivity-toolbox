Fetal neuroimaging is a growing field that uses a variety of techniques, such as the resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) used in this study, to investigate fetal brain function. Visualizing 4D rs-fcMRI, however, can be challenging because of the high number of connections in the brain. Our application, the Fetal Functional Connectivity Toolbox, hopes to assist researchers and clinicians to more effectively explore and understand their data, and communicate their findings by providing multiple tools to visualize the fetal functional connectome.
